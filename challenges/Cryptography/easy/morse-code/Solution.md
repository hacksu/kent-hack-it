## Steps
#### Step 1
Recognize the audio file is broadcasting [Morse code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code). You'll need to listen carefully to identify the dots (short beeps) and dashes (long beeps).

#### Step 2
Use an audio editing tool like Audacity to visualize the waveform, or listen carefully to transcribe the Morse code patterns. You can also use online Morse code decoders that accept audio files, such as [morsecode.world's audio decoder](https://morsecode.world/international/decoder/audio-decoder-adaptive.html).

#### Step 3
Decode the Morse code sequence using a reference chart or online decoder:
- Short beep = dot (.)
- Long beep = dash (-)
- Longer pauses separate letters
- Even longer pauses separate words

#### Step 4
The decoded message will reveal the flag in the format requested: `khi{squirrel_power}`
