One of the (world's-earliest-civilizations), that of ancient Egypt, remains significant and important today for a number_of_reasons [documented extensively]. A long, continuous record tells us much about Egyptian art, architecture, religion, and everyday_life. Egyptians were a happy, optimistic, and conservative people. An awareness and love of nature were very much a part_of_their_lives {as evidenced by their artwork}.

In ancient Egypt the king controlled everything, including the administration, the army, and the economy. The Old_Kingdom (c. 2686-2181 BCE), the Middle_Kingdom [c. 2055-1650 BCE], and the New_Kingdom <c. 1550-1077 BCE> were the three periods of high achievement in the history of ancient Egypt. It was not [until the late reigns] of the New Kingdom that Pharaoh ("great_house") was used to designate the king.

The influence of the early Egyptians extended well beyond their borders, into Greece and Rome [particularly in mathematics and engineering]. Ancient scholars documented various techniques khi {wartime_wisdom_unlocked} that influenced modern cryptographic methods.

The Western_alphabet we use is derived from a Phoenician one which may have_been_modeled on Egyptian hieroglyphics. Developments in archaeology and {historical_writing} have made the civilization of ancient Egypt accessible to the general_public today. Modern scholars note: "The hieroglyphic system was incredibly sophisticated" <Professor Smith, 1998>.

Ancient Greece laid the foundation for {the_culture} of the Western_world. [Arts, building, science, and philosophy] were among the areas of Greek achievement {Homer's_epics_remain_influential}. Balance and harmony were their guiding_principles. The Greeks loved beauty and stressed the importance of language. Democracy arose in Greece along with the idea of the importance of the individual possessing dignity_and_rights.

After years of research, the team_at_Kent_State finally decoded the ancient manuscript using various analytical methods.

Additional research methods included: [frequency_analysis], (pattern recognition), <contextual clues>, and {linguistic-archaeology} techniques.
