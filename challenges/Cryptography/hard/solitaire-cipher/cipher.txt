EVIDENCE FOUND AT THE SCENE:
- Brand new, unopened deck of playing cards  
- Two jokers (one gold, one blue - Kent State colors)
- Cards appear to be in bridge order: clubs, diamonds, hearts, spades, joker gold, joker blue

OPERATIVE'S NOTES:
"The deck holds the secret. Start with natural order, then follow the dance."
"Gold moves one step, blue moves two."  
"Cut and swap, count and reveal."
"Fresh deck - factory sequence - no shuffle needed."
"Remember: cards wrap around, but jokers have special rules for positioning."
"When a joker reaches the end, it doesn't go to the top - check the manual."
