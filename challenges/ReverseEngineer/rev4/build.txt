You need to have dotnet installed on your system.

1.)
```
cd Creation
dotnet run
```

2.)
After it generates variables copy and paste them into the `Lyolan.cs` file
within Project.

3.)
Then run `dotnet build` to generate the DLL. (CHANGE THE VARIABLES BEFORE THIS STEP)

4.)
To create the flag.enc go into the Test.Project folder and run `dotnet test`.

    HOW 2 SERVE:
This challenge you serve the DLL and flag.enc in a zip archive.

    SOLUTION:
Reverse Engineer the DLL to discover AES encryption and off-site pulling for
the KEY and IV, create a script to take files and decode AES using KEY and IV
to read the flag in plain-text.
