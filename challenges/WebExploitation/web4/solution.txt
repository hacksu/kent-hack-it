The user will be presented to a normal site where you can filter using a search bar.
This search bar has a danagerous vulnerability, SSTI. An attacker can use this vulnerability
to achieve RCE and run system commands on the system running the flask web-app.

The user will find a SSTI payload that will let them into the system as (extreme low user) www-data
and read a file to get the flag!

Payload example:
{{config.__class__.__init__.__globals__['os'].popen('id').read()}}
