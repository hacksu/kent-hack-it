The user will enter the site and interact with it a little bit, but if you observer the requests
being sent from you to the site there is a `/images/render_image.php` request that could be a
LFI vector.

Before the LFI the user could discover a `/admin` path that can be reached only it redirects to `/`.

`http://localhost:8080/images/render_image.php?image=../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd`
`http://localhost:8080/images/render_image.php?image=/etc/passwd`
Both will display the contents of the /etc/passwd file on the browser.

The attacker will enumerate the site via this LFI until they hit auth.php and extract the JWT secret.
`http://localhost:8080/images/render_image.php?image=../auth.php`


`http://localhost:8080/images/render_image.php?image=../admin.php`
The user will review this source file to figure out how they need to forge the JWT in order to gain access to `/admin`
The user can also use something like jwt.io to decode the jwt and experiement by flipping the isadmin value to true.

Once an admin JWT token is forged, the user can upload a reverse shell file in order to gain a shell on the machine
where the user can look around the system and find the flag.txt file.
