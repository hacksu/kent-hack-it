```bash
# use ACL to prevent www-data from reading proc files
# needs to be set up for this challenge to prevent an unintential solution
# if www-data can read /proc they can view the /proc/self/environ or /proc/self/cmdline
# and see the flag and we dont want that!
sudo apt-get install acl
sudo setfacl -m u:www-data:0 /proc
getfacl /proc
```

The user will go onto the website and look around to see a login page
they will not have a credential and they will also see from recon /admin
is a valid path but cannot access it without a credential.

Looking around more on the base-site the user will notice a potential LFI
in the URL when viewing stories, they will exploit this LFI to read login.php
and see a hashed password they need to crack (rockyou.txt), once cracked they
will login to the admin page where they can view the flag!
