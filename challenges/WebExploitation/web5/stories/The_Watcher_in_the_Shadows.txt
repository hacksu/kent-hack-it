Sarah had always been fascinated by antiques. One day, she found an old, dusty mirror at a flea market. The seller warned her that the mirror had a dark past, but Sarah, not believing in superstitions, bought it anyway. She hung it in her living room, and for the first few weeks, everything seemed fine. But then, strange things started happening.

One night, she saw the reflection of herself smiling—when she wasn’t.
