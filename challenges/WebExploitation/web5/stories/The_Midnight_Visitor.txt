Late one night, John was working late in his office when he heard a soft knock on the door. He opened it to find no one there, just a strange shadow that seemed to move on its own. Intrigued and a bit frightened, John followed the shadow down the hallway. The shadow led him to a room he had never seen before. Inside, there was an old man who claimed to be a time traveler. The man told John that he was the only one who could help him fix a time anomaly. After hours of conversation, John agreed to help, and they worked together to correct the timeline.
