Every evening, when the sun set and the sky darkened, Alex would walk his dog down the quiet street near his home. Lately, he had felt the distinct sensation of being watched. At first, it was subtle—a flicker of movement in the corner of his eye, the feeling of someone just behind him. One evening, while walking past an alley, he turned around and caught a glimpse of a figure in the shadows. It was tall, cloaked, and vanished as soon as he looked directly at it. His heart raced, but he didn’t say anything. The next night, he walked the same route, but this time, the shadow was waiting for him.
