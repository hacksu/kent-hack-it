It was a typical morning, and Tim was waiting at the bus stop as he always did. But today was different. There was a stranger standing next to him, dressed in an old-fashioned suit and holding a briefcase. The man didn’t speak a word, only stared straight ahead. After a few moments, the bus arrived, and the stranger got on first, followed by Tim. Tim took a seat near the back, but the strange man continued to stand at the front, his briefcase pressed tightly against his chest. As the bus reached the next stop, the man was gone—vanished without a trace, leaving Tim to wonder if he had imagined the whole thing.
