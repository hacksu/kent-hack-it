Lena had always loved hiking in the forest near her home, but there was one part of the forest she never ventured into. The locals called it "The Whispering Forest" because, at certain times of the year, it seemed as though the trees themselves were whispering secrets to each other. One day, overcome with curiosity, Lena decided to explore it. As she walked deeper into the woods, she began to hear the whispers, soft and unintelligible at first, but then becoming louder and more distinct. "Come closer," they seemed to say. "You’re one of us now." Suddenly, the ground beneath her feet gave way, and she fell into an ancient underground cavern, where the whispers turned into eerie laughter.
